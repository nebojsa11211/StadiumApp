\# Project Memory



\## Tools and MCP Usage

\- Always use \*\*Playwright MCP\*\* when browser automation, testing, or scraping tasks could be useful.

\- Always use \*\*Context7 MCP\*\* when extended context, document analysis, or broader memory retrieval is needed.

\- Always use \*\*subagents\*\* whenever their specialized capabilities can help or are required.



\## Guideline

These tools should be applied proactively, not only when explicitly requested, but whenever they can make the workflow more effective or provide better results.
