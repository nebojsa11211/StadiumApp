## Detailed Test Evidence

### Log Search Response Analysis
The log search returned comprehensive log entries showing:

```json
{
  "logs": [
    {
      "id": 9,
      "timestamp": "2025-09-05T09:12:25.1369752",
      "level": "Info",
      "category": "UserAction",
      "action": "ViewLogs",
      "userId": "1",
      "userEmail": "admin@stadium.com", 
      "userRole": "Admin",
      "ipAddress": "::1",
      "userAgent": "curl/8.14.1",
      "requestPath": "/api/logs/search",
      "httpMethod": "POST",
      "details": "Filter: Page=1, PageSize=5, Level=Info",
      "source": "API"
    }
    // ... 4 more entries
  ],
  "totalCount": 9,
  "page": 1,
  "pageSize": 5, 
  "totalPages": 2
