  ```bash
  git log -1 --oneline > pre-migration-version.txt
  ```
- [x] **1.3** Create migration working directory
  ```bash
  mkdir migration-$(date +%Y%m%d)
  cd migration-$(date +%Y%m%d)
  ```
- [x] **1.4** Test current application functionality (record baseline)
- [x] **1.5** Export current database statistics for comparison

### ✅ **Step 2: Supabase Setup**
- [x] **2.1** Create new Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
- [x] **2.2** Note down the following credentials:
  - [x] Project URL: `https://YOUR_PROJECT_ID.supabase.co`

- [x] **2.4** Ensure project is in the correct region for your users

### ✅ **Step 3: Pre-Migration Validation**
- [x] **3.1** Run SQLite validation queries from `validation-scripts.sql`
  ```bash
  sqlite3 ../StadiumDrinkOrdering.db < ../validation-scripts.sql > pre-migration-report.txt
  ```
- [x] **3.2** Record current data counts and save for comparison:
  - [x] Users: _____ records

  ```sql
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public' ORDER BY table_name;
  ```
- [x] **4.4** Verify all indexes were created:
  ```sql
  SELECT indexname, tablename FROM pg_indexes WHERE schemaname = 'public' ORDER BY tablename;
  ```
- [x] **4.5** Test foreign key relationships by running sample joins

### ✅ **Step 5: Data Export from SQLite**
- [x] **5.1** Install Python dependencies for migration script:
  ```bash
  pip install sqlite3 psycopg2-binary
  ```

      'host': 'YOUR_SUPABASE_HOST.supabase.co',
      'database': 'postgres', 
      'user': 'postgres',
      'password': 'YOUR_SUPABASE_PASSWORD',
      'port': '5432'
  }
  ```
- [x] **5.3** Run the migration script:
  ```bash
  python data-migration-script.py
  ```
- [x] **5.4** Review migration report and ensure no critical errors
